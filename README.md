# DJ-prj2
Django project built while learning by doing. Based on YouTube tutorials with minor customizations. Backend-focused.


# Project Title

This is a Django-based project built as part of my learning journey. Iâ€™m currently focusing on backend development, and I follow YouTube tutorials to understand how things work by doing them practically.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Django (Python)
- HTML/CSS (basic frontend, mostly from the tutorials)
- SQLite (default Django DB)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This project is built for educational purposes. Most of the structure and logic is based on a YouTube tutorial, with minor personal edits and improvements. Frontend is not my main focus currently.
